Iâ€™m a statistician working on ecological (and some other biological) questions. Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly astronomical time series. Currently in a gap year physically located in Madison WI.

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics. The most recent projects are: 
  - graphical and variable selection of Gaussian chain graph models
  - detecting [flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) of [M-dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) using data from the [TESS mission](https://tess.mit.edu/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff
