I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable selection and their applications in ecological (and some other biological) questions, deal with (Bayesian) statistics problems when exchangeability breaks due to the structure of the problems. On the ecology side, I study the population and community aspects of large carnivores (esp. wolves). Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly photometric and spectrum time series data collected by space telescopes.

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, genetics and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department) and doing ecology stuff as a side. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got the worst score during undergrad.
