I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study statistics and their applications in ecological, biological and physical problems. I mainly focus on cases when data could be represented by some [measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)) and the goal is to infer some kind of dynamics in time or some other physical factors, sometimes referred to as "population dynamics" problem but it is different from the ecological use of that term. On the ecology side, I study population and community aspects of large carnivores (esp. wolves) as well as their economic values. On the astronomy side, I study the diversity of supernovae (especially type Ia).

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, genetics and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department) and doing ecology stuff as a side. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got the worst score during undergrad.
