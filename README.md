I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable selection and their applications in ecological (and some other biological) questions. Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly astronomical time series data collected by space telescopes. 

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, biology and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department). The most recent projects are: 
  - Bayesian nonparametrics for rare variant association studies, Beta processes and extensions, and potential application in biodiversity survey;
  - graphical and variable selection of Gaussian chain graph models using LASSO/spike-and-slab LASSO, their theory, interpretations and applications in community ecology;
  - population estimation of snow leopard and survey design.  
  - detecting [flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) of [M-dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) using data from the [TESS mission](https://tess.mit.edu/).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got worst score during undergrad.
