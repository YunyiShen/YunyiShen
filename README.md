I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable selection and their applications in ecological (and some other biological) questions. Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly photometric and spectrum time series data collected by space telescopes. 

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, biology and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department). The most recent projects are: 
  - Bayesian nonparametric with relaxed exchangability assumptions, multivariate random measures and species sampling problem with heterogeneity, with applications in rare variant association studies, Indian Buffet process and extensions
  - graphical and variable selection of Gaussian chain graph models using LASSO/spike-and-slab LASSO, their asymptotic theories, interpretations and applications in community ecology;
  - population growth and expansion of Wisconsin wolves (*Canis lupus*);  
  - detecting [flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) of [M-dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) using data from the [TESS mission](https://tess.mit.edu/).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got worst score during undergrad.
