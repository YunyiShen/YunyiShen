Iâ€™m a statistician working on ecological (and some other biological) questions. Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly astronomical time series. Currently in a gap year physically located in Madison WI and I will join the EECS department at MIT as a PhD student summer 2022. 

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics. The most recent projects are: 
  - graphical and variable selection of Gaussian chain graph models and multivariate spike-and-slab LASSO;
  - detecting [flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) of [M-dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) using data from the [TESS mission](https://tess.mit.edu/);
  - understanding community ecology on the [Apostle Island](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Apostle+Islands/@46.9549527,-90.8812504,10.28z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x52a8f887c4797d43:0x8009ed773211222d!8m2!3d47.0027301!4d-90.6908353).  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: yshen99@wisc.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got worst score during undergrad.
