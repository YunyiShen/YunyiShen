I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study Bayesian nonparametrics, variable selection and their applications in ecological (and some other biological) questions. Also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly photometric and spectrum time series data collected by space telescopes. 

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, genetics and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department). The most recent projects are: 
  - Bayesian nonparametric, species and feature sampling problem with heterogeneity, multivariate random measure and applications
  - Graphical and variable selection of Gaussian chain graph models using LASSO/spike-and-slab LASSO, their asymptotic theories, interpretations and applications in community ecology;
  - Population growth and spatial expansion of gray wolves (*Canis lupus*), large scale capture-recapture models;  
  - Detecting [flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare) of [M-dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf) using data from the [TESS mission](https://tess.mit.edu/).

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got worst score during undergrad.
