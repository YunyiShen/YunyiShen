I am a PhD candidate in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study scientific machine learning and statistics with applications in genetics, biophysics and astronomy. I used to be a field ecologist and I keep a line of work on large carnivores (big cats and dogs in the wild). I consider myself more of a naturalist liking animals and stars and willing to study them. Most of my academic work can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=943yT78AAAAJ&hl=en) and arxiv.

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, genetics and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department) and doing ecology stuff as a side. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff
