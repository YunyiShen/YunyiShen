I am a PhD student in the EECS department at MIT affiliated with [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). I study Bayesian nonparametric, variable selection, inverse problems and their applications in ecological, biological and physical problems. I mainly focus on the experimental design aspect when data and problems are structured (spatial, temporal, etc.). On the ecology side, I study population and community aspects of large carnivores (esp. wolves). I also have some interest in astrostatistics, particularly photometric and spectrum time series data collected by space telescopes and designing of simulation based inference.

Quick Facts:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on statistical problems in ecology, genetics and astronomy
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistics (in a CS department) and doing ecology stuff as a side. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any statistical ecology/astronomy stuff

- âš¡ Fun fact: Intro to Statistics is one of the courses I got the worst score during undergrad.
